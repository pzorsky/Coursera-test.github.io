THIS IS MY FIRST TRIAL WITH GITHUB

It has been very difficult understanding how git, github, and Github pages operate
The coursera course needs to spend considerably more time on Github and its use wrt website building. it seems to be a most important tool. Perhaps, others have the experience, expose needed for Github use but I suspect a significant number of students are also struggling.
